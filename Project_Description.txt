Prject Description.
--------------------

- The project is a plug-in tab panel called IGI plug-ins 
- The Tab panel contains 4 isolated plug-in 

1 - plug-in (1): Grid creation.
		
		     - it is used to create Grids in both X-Direction and Y-Direction in on click 
		       with customed spacing between the Grids.
			
		       * Future Inhancement :  Making the process of creating grids more dynamic by identifing the 
					       number of grids in X-Diection and the Spacing between them 
					       and the number of Grids in Y-Direction and spacing between them.
	
			
-----------------------------------------------------
	
2 - plug-in (2): Columns creation.
		
		     - it is used to create Columns at Grids intersection in one click from level 1 to level 2
		       with specific type (450X 600mm)
			
		       * Future Inhancement :  Making the process of creating Columns more dynamic by identifing the 
					       Type of columns and the level of creation 

-----------------------------------------------------

3 - plug-in (3): Foundation creation.
		
		     - it is used to create isolated footing at Grids intersection and under columns
		       in one click. with specific type.
			
		       * Future Inhancement :  Making the process of creating Isolated Footings more dynamic 
					       by identifing the fammily of foundation (isolated - slab)
					       and the type of foundation (Dimensions)

-----------------------------------------------------
4 - plug-in (4): Slab creation.
		
		     - it is used to create  Structural floor Slab with specific type at level 2.
			 
		       * Future Inhancement :  Making the process of creating Structural floor Slab  more dynamic 
					       by identifying type of slab and (Dimensions)

-----------------------------------------------------
5 - plug-in (5): Creating dimensions for the Grids.
		
		     - it is used to create The Dmensions between the Grids indevidulas and the total width of the Grids
		       in both X-Directuion and Y-Direction in one click.
			 
		       * Future Inhancement :  Creatin dimensions between structural elements (Foundation - columns)
					       Faces in all direction and the  nearest Grids.
